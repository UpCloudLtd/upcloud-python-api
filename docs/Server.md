# Start / Stop / Restart

```python

server.stop()
server.start()
server.restart()

# populate the object with updated information from API
server.populate()

```

Please note that the server might not be stopped/started/restarted immediately when the API responds. The `.populate()` method updates the object's fields from the API and is thus useful for checking `server.state`.

```
Server states:
	"started","stopped" -- server is shut down or running
	"maintenance" 		-- when shutting down or (re)starting
	"error" 			-- erronous state in UpCloud's backend
```



## List / Get

The CloudManager returns Server instances.

```python

servers = manager.get_servers()
server = manager.get_server(servers[0].uuid)

```

## Create

Creation of servers in the API is handled by the CloudManager. It accepts a Server instance, forms the correct POST request and populates the Server instance's fields from the POST response.

```python

server = Server(
			core_number = 1,
			memory_amount = 1024,
			hostname = "web1.example.com",
			zone = 'uk-lon1',
			storage_devices = [
				Storage(os = "01000000-0000-4000-8000-000030200200", size=10),
				Storage(size=10, tier="hdd")
			])

manager.create_server( server )

```

Currently available operating system templates can be retrieved with 'manager.get_templates()'. More information on this method can be found in storage_mixin documentation.

Please refer to the [API documentation](https://www.upcloud.com/static/downloads/upcloud-apidoc-1.1.1.pdf) for the allowed Server attributes.

## Update

### Attributes

Updating a Server's attributes is done with its `.save()` method that does a PUT request. If you want to manage the Server's Storages or IP-addresses, see below.

```python

server = manager.get_server( uuid )
server.core_number = 4
server.memory_amount = 4096
server.save()

```

The following fields of Server instance may be updated, all other fields are read-only. Trying to assign values to other fields leads to an error.

```python
Updateable attributes:
	"boot_order", "core_number", "firewall", "hostname", "memory_amount",
	"nic_model", "title", "timezone", "video_model", "vnc", "vnc_password"
```

Please refer to the [API documentation](https://www.upcloud.com/static/downloads/upcloud-apidoc-1.1.1.pdf) for the allowed values.

### Storages

A Server's Storages can be attached and detached with `.add_storage()` and `.remove_storage()`. Both requests issue an API request instantly.

```python

# attach
storage = manager.create_storage( size=100, zone='fi-hel1' )
server.add_storage(storage)

# detach
storage = server.storage_devices[1]
server.remove_storage(storage)

```

### IP-addresses

A Server's IPs can be attached and detached with `.add_ip()` and `.remove_ip()`. Both requests issue an API request instantly. Note that the attached IP is allocated randomly as UpCloud's does not (yet) support floating IPs.

```python

# attach
IP = server.add_ip()

# detach
server.remove_ip(IP)

```

## Delete

Destroys the Server instance and its IP addresses. However, it does not destroy the Storages.

```python

server.destroy()

```

## Delete with storages

Storages attached to the server and storage backups can also be deleted when deleting the server through CloudManager.
Backups can be deleted only when attached storages are also deleted. Default policy for backup deletions is
`KEEP`, but `KEEP_LATEST` and `DELETE` are also supported. Options are configured through BackupDeletionPolicy enum
under storage. Default behaviour for backups and storages is always to keep them.

Following example deletes the storages, but keeps the latest existing backup(s). If no backup exists for the storage(s),
nothing is left behind.

```python

from upcloud_api.storage import BackupDeletionPolicy

manager.delete_server(uuid, delete_storages=True, backups=BackupDeletionPolicy.KEEP_LATEST)

```
