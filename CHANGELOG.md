## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2021-05-05

Python 2 is no longer supported. This is a maintenance release without
that many added features. It was mostly done to make future development easier.

### Added

- Storage upload accepts filenames in strings and PathLike or BinaryIO variables.
- Code style is now guarded by Black, flake8, isort etc.
- Improved documentation and its examples, especially regarding server creation and storage uploads.

### Changed

- Huge amount of fixups in project tests, style and imports by [akx](https://github.com/akx). Thank you! :heart:
- Zone default from storage creation has been removed, making zone a required variable with `create_storage()`.
- Passwords for server user are not created by default if SSH keys are provided.
- Tests and deployments moved fully from CircleCI to GitHub Actions.
- Fixed storage upload not reading the file into memory before uploading.
- Moved to fully using setup.cfg instead of requirements.txt.

        core_number=2,
        memory_amount=1024,
        hostname='my.example.com',

----

## [0.3.7] - 4 Aug 2016

- support for Server.user_data
- improve Server.stop_and_destroy
  - automatically populates server data from api unless sync=False param is given

Bugfix: allow new Firewall attributes, add comment attribute default

----

## [0.3.4] - 21 Jun 2016

**Support `avoid_host` and `login_user` features of UpCloud's Servers API.**

```
from upcloud_api.server import Server, login_user_block

Server.avoid_host = <host_id>
Server.login_user = login_user_block(username : String, ssh_keys : List[String], create_password : Bool)
```

Note: username is optional (defaults to `root` in API)

**Improve `Server.get_public_ip(self, addr_family='IPv4', strict=False`)**

<https://github.com/UpCloudLtd/upcloud-python-api/commit/ec16d0ce05b605c8e6e44e1ed57e309020797fa4>

----

## [0.3.3] - 8 Feb 2016

Allow setting timeout via

`manager = upcloud_api.CloudManager('username', 'password', timeout)`

or

`manager.timeout = timeout` (although this should probably be avoided)

where timeout is an integer (seconds) or `None` (forever) or anything accepted by `requests` library as described [here](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/?highlight=timeout#timeouts)

----

## [0.3.2] - 30 Nov 2015

Small update, adds functionality to manage preconfigured servers ("fixed plan", see upcloud.com/pricing/)

- `plan` attribute for Server
- `Server.save()` works even if the instance has not been populated from API

----

## [0.3.1] - 20 Jul 2015

Small update introducing Tags

- `Tag` class and `TagManager` mixin for `CloudManager`
- see `upcloud_api/cloud_manager/tag_mixin.py` and `upcloud_api/tag.py`

----

## [0.3.0] - 15 Jul 2015

Major release introducing python2/3 support and several features for Ansible inventory/modules

- **PyPi relase renamed to `upcloud-api`** (`pip install upcloud-api`)
- **Package renamed to `upcloud_api`** (`import upcloud_api`)
- versions supported: 2.6, 2.7, 3.3+
  - drop 3.2 support ([future](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future) does not support it)
- new convenience functions for Server:
  - server.stop_and_destroy() - wait for server to stop, then destroy it and its storages
  - server.ensure_started() - wait for server to be started
  - server.to_dict()  - JSON serialisable dict including storages an IP-addresses
- password delivery `"none"` by default. (no annoying emails about new servers)
- some code quality improvements, like using strictly absolute imports within the codebase

----

## [0.2.0] - 29 Jun 2015

Major update with new features related to UpCloud's API v1.2

- major change: use UpCloud's API v1.2
- add FirewallRule management (see [documentation](http://upcloudltd.github.io/upcloud-python-api/Firewall/))
- add option to add IPv6 addresses (`server.add_IP("IPv6")`)
- ship files required for running tests with the [PyPI release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/upcloud-api-python/0.2.0)
- updates to documentation and README.md
- live tests against UpCloud's API - these are NOT shipped with PyPI release as they are extremely dangerous. `py.test` will not run these tests and they require extra confirmation / cloud credentials. This version has been tested manually and automatically against the UpCloud v1.2 API.

----

## [0.1.1] - 23 Jun 2015

Move to X.Y.Z versioning and bump version from 0.1(.0) to 0.1.1

- added MANIFEST.in, tox.in, setup.cfg and removed docs/html from git (built by mkdocs from md sources)
- sublime project file and some readme.md improvements
